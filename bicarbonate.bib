  abstract        = {During exercise, less additional CO2 is stored per kilogram body weight in children than in adults, suggesting that children have a smaller capacity to store metabolically produced CO2. To examine this, tracer doses of [13C]bicarbonate were administered orally to 10 children (8-12 yr) and 12 adults (25-40 yr) at rest. Washout of 13CO2 in breath was analyzed to estimate recovery of tracer, mean residence time (MRT), and size of CO2 stores. CO2 production (VCO2) was also measured breath by breath using gas exchange techniques. Recovery did not differ significantly between children [73 +/- 13% (SD)] and adults (71 +/- 9%). MRT was shorter in children (42 +/- 7 min) compared with adults (66 +/- 15 min, P less than 0.001). VCO2 per kilogram was higher in the children (5.4 +/- 0.9 ml.min-1.kg-1) compared with adults (3.1 +/- 0.5, P less than 0.0001). Tracer estimate of CO2 production was correlated to VCO2 (r = 0.86, P less than 0.0001) and when corrected for mean recovery accurately predicted the VCO2 to within 3 +/- 14%. There was no difference in the estimate of resting CO2 stores between children (222 +/- 52 ml CO2/kg) and adults (203 +/- 42 ml CO2/kg). We conclude that orally administered [13C]bicarbonate can be used to assess CO2 transport dynamics. The data do not support the hypothesis of lower CO2 stores under resting conditions in children.},

  abstract        = {Because the natural enrichment of carbohydrate with 13C is greater than that of lipid, we hypothesized that the natural enrichment of exhaled CO2 with 13C (EN) could be used to gauge endogenous substrate utilization in exercising human subjects. To test this, EN and the respiratory exchange ratio (R) which equals the respiratory quotient (RQ) in the steady state, were measured simultaneously in seven subjects. Rest and exercise protocols, performed under conditions of room air (sea level) and hypoxic (inspired O2 fraction = 0.15) breathing, were chosen to cause a variety of patterns of oxidative substrate utilization. Work rates were performed both below and above the subject's lactate threshold (LT). Work above the LT was expected to cause the greatest increase in EN reflecting greater utilization of glucose. There was significant intersubject (P less than 0.05) but not intrasubject variability in resting EN. By 40 min of exercise, EN increased significantly (P less than 0.05) over resting values in all exercise protocols during both room air and hypoxia conditions. In the room air studies, we found no difference in EN during the below-LT work, even though there were significant increases in O2 uptake (VO2). In contrast, above-LT work resulted in significantly greater increases in EN by 20 and 40 min of exercise (P less than 0.05). Contrary to our expectations, we observed no separate effect by hypoxia on the EN during exercise. Both EN and R tended to increase from rest to exercise, but during exercise there was no overall correlation between R and the EN. EN reflects changes in endogenous substrate utilization over relatively long periods of time such as at rest, but delays in the appearance of 13CO2 at the mouth due to dilution in body CO2 pools, and possibly isotopic fractionation, preclude the usefulness of EN as an indicator of endogenous fuel mix during short-term exercise.},

  abstract        = {The effect of changes in metabolic rate on the dynamics of CO2 exchange among its various compartments in the human body is not well understood. We examined CO2 dynamics in six healthy male subjects using an intravenous bolus of [13C]bicarbonate. Subjects were studied while resting, during light exercise [50% of the lactate threshold (LT), 3-4 times resting O2 uptake (VO2)], and during moderate exercise (95% of the LT, 6 times resting VO2). The sum of three exponential terms well described the washout of 13CO2 in exhaled breath both at rest and during each exercise level despite substantial increases in metabolic rate accompanying the exercise studies. Average recovery of 13C label rose from 67% during rest to 80% during light and moderate exercise (P less than 0.01). The estimate of CO2 elimination (VCO2) calculated from the washout parameters and corrected for recovery was in very good agreement with the VCO2 directly measured simultaneously breath by breath (r = 0.993, SE for VCO2 = 0.079 l/min). By use of a three-compartment mammillary model, the quantity of CO2 in the central pool (Q1) doubled from rest to light exercise (233 +/- 60 to 479 +/- 76 mmol, P less than 0.01) but did not change further with moderate exercise (458 +/- 74 mmol). Rate constants for exchange between pools and for irreversible loss from the system tended to increase with metabolic rate, but there was large variation in the responses. We conclude that the compartmental dynamics of CO2 transport and storage are very sensitive to changes in metabolic rate induced by exercise.},

In the present study we tested the effect of certain assumptions of this model on the prediction of the change in exchangeable bicarbonate with the increased metabolic rate of exercise. We compared this prediction with a measurement of CO2 retention after exercise onset determined from gas exchange data. The change in tissue bicarbonate stores was estimated from differences in the kinetics of adjustment of VO2 and VCO2, and this was added to an estimate of the changes in venous blood gas stores to estimate the total change in bicarbonate. When the commonly held assumption that endogenous CO2 production, thought to occur in a rapidly equilibrating peripheral compartment at rest, was also applied to the exercise condition, the three-compartment bicarbonate model predicted an unphysiologically large increase in bicarbonate stores (700 mmol, or over 15 L). In contrast, the 'gas exchange' approach predicted a relatively small increase in bicarbonate (26 mmol), consistent with other reports. The incompatibility of these findings with the assumption about the source of endogenous CO2 production in the bicarbonate model requires that the underlying physiological correlates of the three compartments change from rest to exercise.},

Gas exchange [O2 uptake and CO2 production (Vco2)] was measured breath by breath during rest and during light (80% of the anaerobic threshold) intermittent exercise. Breath samples were obtained for subsequent analysis of 13CO2 by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The tracer estimate of Vco2 was highly correlated to Vco2 measured by gas exchange (r = 0.97, P < 0.0001). The mean residence time was shorter in children (50 +/- 5 min) compared with adults (69 +/- 7 min, P < 0.0001) at rest and during exercise (children, 35 +/- 7 min; adults, 50 +/- 11 min, P < 0.001). The estimate of stored CO2 (using mean Vco2 measured by gas exchange and mean residence time derived from tracer washout) was not statistically different at rest between children (254 +/- 36 ml/kg) and adults (232 +/- 37 ml/kg). During exercise, CO2 stores in the adults (304 +/- 46 ml/kg) were significantly increased over rest (P < 0.001), but there was no increase in children (mean exercise value, 254 +/- 38 ml/kg). These data support the hypothesis that CO2 distribution in response to exercise changes during the growth period.},

  abstract        = {A [13C]-breath test is a promising method for measuring gastric emptying. The methodological relevance is based on a close correspondence between gastric emptying of [13C]-acetate/octanoate (input) and pulmonary excretion of [13CO2] (output). Despite the close input-output correspondence, the pulmonary output is quite remote from the gastric input: the pulmonary output is delayed compared to the gastric input, and the total recovery of [13CO2] in the breath is incomplete. This review focuses on the kinetics of [13C]-acetate/octanoate in the body and suggests that (1) the delayed pulmonary output results from temporal retention of [13CO2] in the well-perfused tissues (heart, brain, etc.), (2) the incomplete recovery results from incorporation of the label into metabolic products (ketone bodies, amino acids, etc.) or from fixation of [13CO2] in the low-perfused tissues (bone, skeletal muscle, etc.), and (3) knowledge on the retention is the key to appropriate interpretations of breath test results. Recognition of these kinetic aspects is essential for appropriate interpretations of these breath test results.},
