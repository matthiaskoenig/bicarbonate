  abstract        = {During exercise, less additional CO2 is stored per kilogram body weight in children than in adults, suggesting that children have a smaller capacity to store metabolically produced CO2. To examine this, tracer doses of [13C]bicarbonate were administered orally to 10 children (8-12 yr) and 12 adults (25-40 yr) at rest. Washout of 13CO2 in breath was analyzed to estimate recovery of tracer, mean residence time (MRT), and size of CO2 stores. CO2 production (VCO2) was also measured breath by breath using gas exchange techniques. Recovery did not differ significantly between children [73 +/- 13% (SD)] and adults (71 +/- 9%). MRT was shorter in children (42 +/- 7 min) compared with adults (66 +/- 15 min, P less than 0.001). VCO2 per kilogram was higher in the children (5.4 +/- 0.9 ml.min-1.kg-1) compared with adults (3.1 +/- 0.5, P less than 0.0001). Tracer estimate of CO2 production was correlated to VCO2 (r = 0.86, P less than 0.0001) and when corrected for mean recovery accurately predicted the VCO2 to within 3 +/- 14%. There was no difference in the estimate of resting CO2 stores between children (222 +/- 52 ml CO2/kg) and adults (203 +/- 42 ml CO2/kg). We conclude that orally administered [13C]bicarbonate can be used to assess CO2 transport dynamics. The data do not support the hypothesis of lower CO2 stores under resting conditions in children.},

  abstract        = {Because the natural enrichment of carbohydrate with 13C is greater than that of lipid, we hypothesized that the natural enrichment of exhaled CO2 with 13C (EN) could be used to gauge endogenous substrate utilization in exercising human subjects. To test this, EN and the respiratory exchange ratio (R) which equals the respiratory quotient (RQ) in the steady state, were measured simultaneously in seven subjects. Rest and exercise protocols, performed under conditions of room air (sea level) and hypoxic (inspired O2 fraction = 0.15) breathing, were chosen to cause a variety of patterns of oxidative substrate utilization. Work rates were performed both below and above the subject's lactate threshold (LT). Work above the LT was expected to cause the greatest increase in EN reflecting greater utilization of glucose. There was significant intersubject (P less than 0.05) but not intrasubject variability in resting EN. By 40 min of exercise, EN increased significantly (P less than 0.05) over resting values in all exercise protocols during both room air and hypoxia conditions. In the room air studies, we found no difference in EN during the below-LT work, even though there were significant increases in O2 uptake (VO2). In contrast, above-LT work resulted in significantly greater increases in EN by 20 and 40 min of exercise (P less than 0.05). Contrary to our expectations, we observed no separate effect by hypoxia on the EN during exercise. Both EN and R tended to increase from rest to exercise, but during exercise there was no overall correlation between R and the EN. EN reflects changes in endogenous substrate utilization over relatively long periods of time such as at rest, but delays in the appearance of 13CO2 at the mouth due to dilution in body CO2 pools, and possibly isotopic fractionation, preclude the usefulness of EN as an indicator of endogenous fuel mix during short-term exercise.},

We examined CO2 dynamics in six healthy male subjects using an intravenous bolus of [13C]bicarbonate. Subjects were studied while resting, during light exercise [50% of the lactate threshold (LT), 3-4 times resting O2 uptake (VO2)], and during moderate exercise (95% of the LT, 6 times resting VO2). The sum of three exponential terms well described the washout of 13CO2 in exhaled breath both at rest and during each exercise level despite substantial increases in metabolic rate accompanying the exercise studies. Average recovery of 13C label rose from 67% during rest to 80% during light and moderate exercise (P less than 0.01). The estimate of CO2 elimination (VCO2) calculated from the washout parameters and corrected for recovery was in very good agreement with the VCO2 directly measured simultaneously breath by breath (r = 0.993, SE for VCO2 = 0.079 l/min). By use of a three-compartment mammillary model, the quantity of CO2 in the central pool (Q1) doubled from rest to light exercise (233 +/- 60 to 479 +/- 76 mmol, P less than 0.01) but did not change further with moderate exercise (458 +/- 74 mmol). Rate constants for exchange between pools and for irreversible loss from the system tended to increase with metabolic rate, but there was large variation in the responses. We conclude that the compartmental dynamics of CO2 transport and storage are very sensitive to changes in metabolic rate induced by exercise.},

In the present study we tested the effect of certain assumptions of this model on the prediction of the change in exchangeable bicarbonate with the increased metabolic rate of exercise. We compared this prediction with a measurement of CO2 retention after exercise onset determined from gas exchange data. The change in tissue bicarbonate stores was estimated from differences in the kinetics of adjustment of VO2 and VCO2, and this was added to an estimate of the changes in venous blood gas stores to estimate the total change in bicarbonate. When the commonly held assumption that endogenous CO2 production, thought to occur in a rapidly equilibrating peripheral compartment at rest, was also applied to the exercise condition, the three-compartment bicarbonate model predicted an unphysiologically large increase in bicarbonate stores (700 mmol, or over 15 L). In contrast, the 'gas exchange' approach predicted a relatively small increase in bicarbonate (26 mmol), consistent with other reports. The incompatibility of these findings with the assumption about the source of endogenous CO2 production in the bicarbonate model requires that the underlying physiological correlates of the three compartments change from rest to exercise.},

The mean residence time was shorter in children (50 +/- 5 min) compared with adults (69 +/- 7 min, P < 0.0001) at rest and during exercise (children, 35 +/- 7 min; adults, 50 +/- 11 min, P < 0.001).

  abstract        = {A [13C]-breath test is a promising method for measuring gastric emptying. The methodological relevance is based on a close correspondence between gastric emptying of [13C]-acetate/octanoate (input) and pulmonary excretion of [13CO2] (output). Despite the close input-output correspondence, the pulmonary output is quite remote from the gastric input: the pulmonary output is delayed compared to the gastric input, and the total recovery of [13CO2] in the breath is incomplete. This review focuses on the kinetics of [13C]-acetate/octanoate in the body and suggests that (1) the delayed pulmonary output results from temporal retention of [13CO2] in the well-perfused tissues (heart, brain, etc.), (2) the incomplete recovery results from incorporation of the label into metabolic products (ketone bodies, amino acids, etc.) or from fixation of [13CO2] in the low-perfused tissues (bone, skeletal muscle, etc.), and (3) knowledge on the retention is the key to appropriate interpretations of breath test results. Recognition of these kinetic aspects is essential for appropriate interpretations of these breath test results.},

  abstract        = {The oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates and amino acids can be measured by quantifying the rate of excretion of labelled CO2 following administration of 14C- or 13C-labelled substrates at whole-body and tissue level. However, there is a theoretical need to correct the oxidation rates for the proportion of labelled CO2 that is produced via oxidation but not excreted. Furthermore, depending on the substrate and position of the C label(s), there may also be a need to correct for labelled C from the metabolized substrate that does not appear as CO2, but rather becomes temporarily fixed in other metabolites. The bicarbonate correction factor is used to correct for the labelled CO2 not excreted. Recently, an acetate correction factor has been proposed for the simultaneous correction of CO2 not excreted and label fixed in other metabolites via isotopic exchange reactions, mainly in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Changes in metabolic rate induced, for example, by feeding, hormonal changes and physical activity, as well as infusion time, have been shown to affect both correction factors. The present paper explains the theoretical and physiological basis of these correction factors and makes recommendations as to how these correction factors should be used in various physiological conditions.},

Following a rapid bolus of NaH13CO3 (10 mumol . kg-1 iv), the decay of 13C enrichment of breath CO2 could be described by a three-exponential decay process and a linearly time-dependent term that accounted for changes in the 13C enrichment of metabolic fuels. The data were fitted subsequently to a mammillary multicompartmental model that consisted of a central pool and two peripheral pools of 3,310, 3,490, and 8,070 mumol . kg-1 HCO-3-CO2. Labeled CO2 was eliminated from the central pool by respiratory and nonrespiratory routes at rates of 101 and 97 mumol . kg-1 . min-1, respectively. The within-subject and among-subject variances were similar for the amount of freely exchangeable bicarbonate (14,870 mumol . kg-1), CO2 output (101 mumol . kg-1 . min-1), bicarbonate flux (198 mumol . kg-1 . min-1), and the fraction of administered bicarbonate recovered in breath (0.51). Comparison of variances associated with the assignment of a population mean value to a new subject and the variance associated with the use of a value obtained in the same individual on another day indicated that there was no advantage to making a determination on an alternate day over using a population value. Efforts should be made to compile population values for bicarbonate kinetics in different age groups and metabolic, nutritional, and pathological states for use in interpretation of nutrient oxidation data.},

We have developed a rapid method to obtain a complete set of bicarbonate kinetic parameters, prime bicarbonate pools with 13C, clamp breath 13CO2 levels rapidly and accurately with predetermined ranges, and provide a steady base-line enrichment of 13C for a subsequent substrate oxidation measurement. The method consists of administering NaH13CO3 intravenously as a combination of a bolus dose, an exponentially decreasing infusion, and a constant infusion. A Harvard model 2729 microprocessor-controlled syringe pump was modified for external control and coupled to a Hewlett-Packard HP-85 desk-top computer to deliver the complex infusion. An infusion algorithm that would rapidly attain and maintain an increase of 50% 13C enrichment of breath CO2 was derived by using the SAAM-27 program to interrogate a three-compartmental model of bicarbonate kinetics in normal, fasted, resting adult subjects. When the method was tested on five adult fasted subjects who had rested for 1.5 h, plateau enrichments were achieved within 10-20 min. The bicarbonate pool sizes and kinetic parameters obtained by compartmental analysis of their 13CO2 data were used to obtain a refined infusion protocol, which resulted in more rapid attainment of plateau enrichments. If carried out immediately before a substrate oxidation test, the method can provide a complete description of bicarbonate kinetics for use in the compartmental and noncompartmental analysis of substrate catabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Elimination of CO2 from labelled bicarbonate was 62.6 +/- 8.1% at rest, 103.6 +/- 11.3% during exercise (P < 0.01) and 43.0 +/- 4.7% during recovery from exercise (P = 0.01). During exercise mean residence time (MRT) was shorter than at rest (35 +/- 7 min vs. 54 +/- 9 min, P < 0.02) and CO2 pool size was larger (998 +/- 160 ml CO2 kg-1, vs. 194 +/- 28 ml CO2 kg-1, P < 0.001). Compared to values obtained at rest, during recovery from exercise, MRT and CO2 pool size were reduced (34 +/- 5 min, P < 0.05; 116 +/- 19 ml CO2 kg-1, P < 0.02, respectively). In an additional five subjects acidosis and alkalosis were induced prior to administration of oral [13C]bicarbonate at rest. Elimination of bicarbonate was lower during acidosis (46.1 +/- 5.6%, P < 0.01) but was unaltered (50.9 +/- 5.6%, NS) during alkalosis, compared to the values obtained at resting pH. During acidosis MRT and CO2 pool size decreased (37 +/- 3 min, P < 0.01 and 123 +/- 10 ml CO2 kg-1, P < 0.01, respectively) whereas in alkalosis MRT was unchanged (65 +/- 8 min NS) but CO2 pool size was increased (230 +/- 23 ml CO2 kg-1, P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In order to establish biological and/or methodological explanations for the wide variability in recovery (50-100%) of labelled CO2 after administration of [13C]bicarbonate or [14C]bicarbonate, 34 human bicarbonate studies involving 480 subjects were analysed, and potential methodological issues were investigated in the laboratory. 2. Overall, continuous infusion studies reported a higher recovery than bolus studies (84 +/- 11% versus 69 +/- 12%; P < 0.001). No significant differences in recovery were found between 14C and 13C studies, children and adults, obese and lean subjects, or rest and exercise (steady state). Higher recoveries were found during feeding than during fasting (84 +/- 8% versus 74 +/- 7%; P < 0.001). Different methods used to analyse the results (0-10%) and different study protocols, which include differences in the duration of infusions and background drift in 13C enrichment (0-10%), contribute to the variability. 3. The laboratory studies suggest multiple sources of potential error, including loss of CO2 from the scintillation fluid (up to > 30%, but only in 14C studies in which the scintillation fluid is not alkalized), diffusion of CO2 through syringes and tubing (0 to > 10%), non-linearity of CO2 analysers (up to 8%), inaccuracies in the measurement of bicarbonate concentrations (13C studies) or the strength of CO2-trapping agents (14C studies; 0-8%). 4. It is concluded that much of the variability in the recovery of labelled bicarbonate is likely to be attributable to methodological differences, and that attention to these will ensure better interpretation of metabolic studies that involve oxidation of carbon-labelled substrates.},

Physiol: Respirat. Environ. Exercise Physiol. 52: 458-466, 1982). We have therefore tested three possible explanations for this apparent incongruity. 1) We infused NaH13CO3 throughout rest and exercise and found that, although altered bicarbonate kinetics in exercise resulted in greater recovery of 13CO2, the difference between rest and recovery was small compared with the increase in the rate of 13CO2 excretion during exercise when [1-13C]leucine was infused. 2) We infused [15N]leucine and isolated plasma urea N to determine directly the rate of incorporation of the 15N. During exercise there was no increase in the rate of 15N incorporation. Simultaneously, we infused [2,3-13C]alanine and quantified the rate of incorporation of 15N in alanine. We found that [15N]alanine production from [15N] leucine more than doubled in exercise, and by deduction, alanine production from other amino acids also doubled. 3) We tested our previous assumption that [1-13C]leucine metabolism in exercise was representative of the metabolism of other essential amino acids by infusing [1-13C] and [alpha-15N]lysine throughout rest and exercise. We found that the rate of breakdown of lysine during exercise was not increased in a manner comparable to that of leucine. Thus, these data confirm our original findings that leucine decarboxylation is enhanced in light exercise but urea production is unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

L-[1-13C]leucine was used as a tracer to calculate leucine oxidation and whole body protein synthesis in six healthy, fed, male athletes in response to a 1 h bout of circuit-set resistance exercise. The measurements were performed prior to, during, and for 2 h after exercise, and corrections were made for background 13CO2/12CO2 breath enrichment and bicarbonate retention factor changes. Results demonstrated significant (P less than 0.01) increases in the background 13CO2/12CO2 breath enrichment at 1 and 2h after exercise and in the bicarbonate retention factor (P less than 0.01) during exercise. At 15 min after exercise, the bicarbonate retention factor was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than at rest. There were no significant effects of exercise on leucine oxidation or flux, whole body protein synthesis, or the rate of appearance of endogenous leucine. We concluded that circuit-set resistance exercise did not affect the measured variables of leucine metabolism. In addition, large errors in calculating leucine oxidation and whole body protein synthesis during resistance exercise can occur if background 13CO2/12CO2 breath enrichment and bicarbonate retention factor changes are not accounted for.},

Recovery and dilution of isotope were assessed from measurements made on continuous collections of CO2, entering and leaving the calorimeter, urine, and intermittent spot breath and saliva samples. Mean recovery of infused label in gaseous CO2 was 95.6 +/- 1.1% (SD) between 12 and 36 h. Applying a 95% mean recovery of label to each subject individually enabled the use of integrated mean specific activity of CO2 in spot breath and urine samples to predict measured net CO2 production and energy expenditure to within about +/- 6%. Estimates based on urinary measurements were compromised slightly by the exchange of label through the bladder wall (this was dependent on pH and volume of urine). It is concluded that this constant-infusion labeled bicarbonate method offers a potentially useful means of assessing net CO2 production and total energy expenditure over the short term (e.g., 1-3 days).},

After a period of equilibration, the mean specific radioactivity of urea was found to be only 16% below that of end expiratory CO2 and a similar amount below that of CO2 both in arterialized blood and in urine. This difference may be explained by isotopic dilution of 14CO2 by metabolic CO2 produced in the splanchnic tissues.

  abstract        = {The aim of this study was to assess the bioequivalence of H13CO-3 and H14CO-3, by administering both labels simultaneously by single infusion and comparing their recovery in breath CO2 and urinary urea. Six healthy male subjects (age range 24-41 years; weight 76.7 (sd, 18.6) kg; height 1.79 (sd 0.05) m) were infused with unprimed solutions of HCO3- (110.0 mmol/kg) labelled with 13C (0.76 mmol 13C/h) and 14C (48 Bq/h) at a constant rate for 6 h, in a whole-body calorimeter (1400 litres) for measurement of CO2 production. Samples of breath were collected hourly in a Douglas bag and all urine was collected into two batches (0-4 h and 4-6 h) for estimating recovery of infused label by measurement of enrichment or specific activity. Recovery in breath CO2 of both labels increased from about 25 % for the first hour to 88 % and above for hours 3-4 onwards. Mean recovery of 13C in breath CO2 was slightly higher than that of 14C for all periods (mean difference always less than 1 % of infused label) but was significant only for the first 3 h (P < 0.05). Recovery of 14C in urea was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than 13C, but was confounded by substantial variability and uncertainties concerning 13CO2 background enrichments. These results suggest that there is no compelling need to alter factors currently used for recovery of 14C in breath when using 13C instead, and vice versa.},

  abstract        = {Five healthy male subjects were continuously infused subcutaneously with [14C]bicarbonate (12.3 microCi/day) using a mini pump for 5 days while in a whole body calorimeter. Energy expenditure was varied over a range of 1.35-1.75 times basal metabolic rate. Urine collections were obtained throughout the study and used to measure the specific activity of urea, from which CO2 production was estimated. It was assumed that the recovery of label in gaseous CO2 was 95% of that infused and that the specific activity of urea was 85% that of expired CO2. Continuous daily collections of calorimeter air revealed that 95.6 +/- 1.3% (SD) of infused label was recovered as gaseous CO2, with little daily variation. Another 1.5 +/- 0.4% was recovered as urinary urea. The estimated CO2 production, calculated from the specific activity of urea in 24-h urine samples corrected for the small effects due to changes in the size and specific activity of the urea pool, was found to be 100 +/- 5% of the calorimeter estimate for 1-day periods (20.80 +/- 1.44 mol CO2/day) and 100 +/- 2% for 4-day periods. This study suggests that, in healthy subjects, the labeled [14C]bicarbonate-urea method can provide reasonable estimates of net CO2 production over the range examined.},

We sought to derive bicarbonate retention factors (k) to correct for carbon tracer oxidized, but retained from pulmonary excretion before, during, and after exercise. Ten men and nine women received a primed-continuous infusion of [(13)C]bicarbonate (sodium salt) under three different conditions: 1) before, during, and 3 h after 90 min of exercise at 45% peak oxygen consumption (Vo(2peak)); 2) before, during, and 3 h after 60 min of exercise at 65% Vo(2peak); and 3) during a time-matched resting control trial, with breath samples collected for determination of (13)CO(2) excretion rates. Throughout the resting control trial, k was stable and averaged 0.83 in men and women. During exercise, average k in men was 0.93 at 45% Vo(2peak) and 0.94 at 65% Vo(2peak), and in women k was 0.91 at 45% Vo(2peak) and 0.92 at 65% Vo(2peak), with no significant differences between intensities or sexes. After exercise at 45% Vo(2peak), k returned rapidly to control values in men and women, but following exercise at 65% Vo(2peak), k was significantly less than control at 30 and 60 min postexercise in men (0.74 and 0.72, respectively, P < 0.05) and women (0.75 and 0.76, respectively, P < 0.05) with no significant postexercise differences between men and women. We conclude that bicarbonate/CO(2) retention is transiently increased in men and women for the first hour of postexercise recovery following endurance exercise bouts of hard but not moderate intensity.},

Indirect calorimetry and the use of specific activity and rate of 14CO2 expired yielded identical values of VCO2: 8.97 +/- 0.82 and 8.80 +/- 0.83 mmol/min, respectively (P = NS). The concentration of NaH13CO3 in the infusates and the 13C enrichment in breath CO2 were determined using gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The rate of appearance of CO2 measured using the NaH13CO3 infusion rate and the steady-state breath 13CO2 enrichments was 11.41 +/- 1.56 mmol/min, which was higher (P < 0.001) than that determined by either of the other two methods. When corrected for the recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of NaH13CO3 by use of published values, rate of appearance of CO2 was 9.24 +/- 0.78 mmol/min, which did not differ from VCO2 determined using the other two methods. We conclude that infusion of NaH13CO3 can be used to determine VCO2. This method should be useful to study the oxidation of substrates in populations such as ventilator-dependent neonates, in whom indirect calorimetry is laborious and inaccurate.},

Subjects were in a fasting state for the first 12 h and at 0600 on day 7 they then received hourly 10 equal meals to achieve a fed state. Total leucine intake (diet plus tracer) was 89.4 mg.kg-1.d-1. Mean daily leucine oxidation was equivalent to 89.5 +/- 3.3 mg leucine/kg. The predicted daily oxidation rate, from measurements made during the last hour of the fast and the fifth hour of the fed period, was 91.2 +/- 5.8 mg/kg (P = 0.25 from measured). Measured and predicted whole-body leucine balances were 0.76 +/- 2.99 and -0.98 +/- 5.54 mg/kg, respectively (P = 0.25). Urea production exceeded urea excretion by 20%; daily protein oxidation was the same when estimated from leucine oxidation or nitrogen excretion. Thus, the tracer-balance concept is valid, and reliable predictions of total daily leucine oxidation and whole-body leucine balance can be obtained from short-term measurements of leucine oxidation during fasted and fed states.},

Over the last 4 hours of the study, steady-state conditions were achieved in the specific activities (SAs) of expired 14CO2 and plasma urea, which was used as a probe for hepatic intracellular CO2 SA. Plasma urea SA was approximately 17% lower than expired CO2 SA (46.4 +/- 5.6 v 56.8 +/- 3.9 disintegrations per minute.mumol-1, P < .02). Fractional 14CO2 recovery was 94.8% +/- 0.8%; when corrected for failure to equilibrate with intracellular CO2, fractional recovery was 89.5% +/- 1.9%. These data indicate that compartmentalization of CO2 may occur in humans. The duration of our experiments, required because of the long half-life of plasma urea, may have minimized the apparent magnitude of compartmentalization. Furthermore, it is possible that compartmentalization in extrahepatic tissues could be of either lesser or greater magnitude than that which we observed in liver. Whether this phenomenon contributes to incomplete recovery of 14CO2 during NaH14CO3 infusion cannot be determined from our results. Additional studies using different experimental approaches will be required to better measure CO2 compartmentalization.},

  abstract        = {Estimates of substrate oxidation obtained from appearance of 13C or 14C from tracers in breath must be corrected for retention of labeled carbon in the body. We aimed to determine the effect of a defined experimental diet and metabolic status on recovery of infused Na [13C]bicarbonate in breath. Six healthy male subjects consumed an experimental diet for 7 days before receiving a continuous infusion of formula without tracer on day 8 and received either an intragastric (ig) or intravenous (iv) infusion of Na [13C]bicarbonate on day 9 or 11 during a 4-h postabsorptive (PA), 4-h continuously fed period. A trend toward increasing PA breath enrichment during the first 7 diet days approached statistical significance (P = 0.051), whereas breath enrichments measured 3 h postbreakfast were consistently higher than PA values throughout and did not change over the 7-day period. Breath enrichments during a 4-h continuous ig infusion of formula without tracer on day 8 rose 2.0 +/- 0.5 atom percent excess (APE).10(-3) above base line (P less than 0.001, ANOVA). In the tracer studies, breath enrichments were similar for the ig and iv routes of tracer infusion. For the ig infusion the fraction of infused Na [13C]bicarbonate recovered in breath as 13CO2 was 0.74 +/- 0.02 for the PA period and 0.79 +/- 0.02 for the fed period. For the iv infusion the fraction recovered was 0.70 +/- 0.04 for the PA period and 0.82 +/- 0.03 for the fed period. Fractional recoveries were not significantly different for ig and iv routes of administration but were different for PA and fed periods (P less than 0.0001, 2-way ANOVA). The fractional recoveries for the fed period obtained here were similar to the value 0.81 reported in a number of other studies. Recovery of tracer in breath increased linearly with O2 uptake and CO2 production, suggesting that factors affecting respiratory gas exchange may alter recovery. We conclude that the primary factor determining label recovery is the immediate and recent nutritional status of the host.},

To estimate the nature and magnitude of this delay, we applied a two-compartment model to describe the kinetics of the body bicarbonate pool and we evaluated the 13C:12C ratio of CO2 entering that pool from the measured 13C:12C ratio in the exhaled CO2 after an oral intake of "naturally labelled" 13C-glucose.

The recovery of tracer-labelled CO 2 generated from the oxidation of 13C labelled substrates may not be 100% over short term. This can lead to underestimation of oxidation rate of substrates, and consequently a correction for the incomplete recovery of tracer has to be applied by the determination of the recovery of 13CO2 in the breath during tracer bicarbonate infusions. We have studied the recovery of tracer-labelled bicarbonate using a bolus administration model, and further characterized kinetics of bicarbonate using a three-compartment model, to assess which compartmental fluxes changed during the change from a fasted state to fed state. Recovery of bicarbonate was lower at 69% and 67% (fasted and fed state) than the value of 71% and 74% found during earlier longer term of continuous infusions. During feeding, there was a 20-fold increase in the flux of bicarbonate between the central compartment and the compartment that was equivalent to the viscera. This study shows that the difference between the fasted and fed state recovery of tracer bicarbonate similar to that obtained with continuous infusions, and that bicarbonate fluxes show large changes between different compartments in the body depending on metabolic state.},

It is a consistent finding in all studies that the total amount of intravenous [13C]bicarbonate cannot be recovered as breath 13CO2. In this study, we used a breath-by-breath analysis of 13CO2 to depict the washout of 13CO2 at a high temporal resolution to analyze the extent to which a probable first-pass effect is responsible for the reduced recovery. Eight healthy men were tested at seated rest and with bicycle exercise at a constant load relative to 40 and 75% maximal O2 consumption VO2 max). [13C]bicarbonate (0.0125 g/kg body wt) was administered as an intravenous bolus in each test. Respiratory mass spectrometry was used to derive the course of the end-tidal 13CO2-to-12CO2 ratio from the breath-by-breath data. Approximately 2 min after 13C administration, the washout curve could be fitted well by a two-exponential curve describing a two-compartment mammillary model. Immediately after administration of the bolus dose, an excess peak in the end-tidal 13CO2-to-12CO2 ratio appeared. This peak could not be included in the two-exponential fitting. The area under the first peak resulted in 3.8 +/- 1.3% of the total [13C]bicarbonate dose at rest, 11.5 +/- 2.9% at moderate exercise (40% VO2 max), and 16.9 +/- 4.0% at intensive exercise (75% VO2 max). The first-pass effect had an increasing impact of up to about two-thirds of the lacking bicarbonate with higher exercise intensity. The "loss" of tracer via this first-pass effect must be considered when the results of studies with parenteral administration of [13C]bicarbonate are considered, especially when it is given as a bolus dose and during exercise.},

The aim of this study is to develop a compartmental model of bicarbonate kinetics in humans from tracer data by devoting particular attention to model identification and validation. The data base consisted of impulse-dose studies of 14C-labeled bicarbonate in nine normal subjects. The decay curve of specific activity of CO2 in expired air (saRCO2) was frequently sampled for 4-7 h. In addition, endogenous production of CO2, VCO2, was measured by indirect calorimetry. A model of data, i.e., an exponential model, analysis of decay curves of saRCO2 showed first that three compartments are necessary and sufficient to describe bicarbonate tracer kinetics. Compartmental models were then used as models of system. To correctly describe the input-output configuration, labeled CO2 flux in the expired air, phi RCO2 (= saRCO2.VCO2), has been used as measurement variable in tracer model identification. A mammillary three-compartment model with a respiratory and a nonrespiratory loss has been studied. Whereas there is good evidence that respiratory loss takes place in the central compartment, whether nonrespiratory loss is taking place in the central compartment or in one of the two peripheral compartments is uncertain. Thus three competing tracer models were considered. Using a model-independent analysis of data, based on the body activity variable, to calculate mean residence time in the system, we have been able to validate a specific model structure, i.e., with the two irreversible losses taking place in the central compartment. This validated tracer model was then used to quantitate bicarbonate masses in the system. Because there is uncertainty about where endogenous production enters the system, lower and upper bounds of masses of bicarbonate in the body are derived.},

To gain insight into the potential problem, we compared 13C/12C ratios of plasma macronutrients to those of breath CO2 under conditions that should alter the percentages of carbohydrate and lipid being oxidized. In rats, 48 h of starvation decreased the 13C/12C ratio of breath CO2 by 3.5%. At this time the 13C/12C ratio of breath CO2 was very similar to that of plasma lipids. In humans, 30 min of heavy exercise increased the breath 13CO2/12CO2 ratio by 1.3%. These changes in breath 13C/12C ratios could be predicted from 13C/12C ratios of plasma macronutrients and the percentage of carbon dioxide derived from each macronutrient, but only when compared within the same populations. For example, the 13C/12C ratios of plasma macronutrients of residents of Chicago, Illinois (USA) and Tokyo (Japan) differed by 1-3%. An empirical correction of 13CO2 breath test data is recommended when breath tests are run under conditions that will change metabolic fuel utilization.},

  abstract        = {The methodology for measuring in vivo oxidation of substrates labeled with the nonradioactive carbon isotope 13C has been developed with isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The use of 13C offers the possibility of utilizing CO2 breath tests in infants, children, pregnant women, and all subjects in whom 14CO2 breath tests cannot be used. The excretion of 140 nmol/kg-hr of 13CO2 produced from the oxidation of the labeled substrate could be detected with 95% confidence during a total CO2 excretion of 9 mM/kg-hr. The precision of CO2 breath tests using 13C is limited by the natural fluctuations of the ratio of 13C/12C in expired CO2, which occur with a standard deviation of 0.72%, or approximately 7 parts 13CO2 per 10(6) parts expired CO2. Larger excursions in the ratio were observed if the subjects ate shortly before or during the breath test. Clinically significant diagnostic tests can reasonably be expected to require the excretion of 2 to 20 times as much labeled CO2, or 0.28 to 1.4 micronM/kg-hr.},

  abstract        = {Systemic metabolism results in a production of not only carbon dioxide, water and urea but also bicarbonate ions. Most of these bicarbonate ions are generated during the catabolism of glutamine. In order to be eliminated as carbon dioxide in the lungs bicarbonate ions must be protonised. This protonisation of the bicarbonate ion seems to take place in a number of tissue compartments in which acid-base balance is maintained. One of the most important processes for protonisation of the bicarbonate ion is the hepatic ureagenesis from ammonia/ammonium ions. A substantial part of the ammonia/ammonium ions are generated during the catabolism of amino acids. Terminal oxidation of glutamine in the gut seems to be of great significance for this process. In certain conditions the enteric generation of ammonium ions seems so important that an ATP-driven enterohepatic recirculation of ammonium ions/urea constituting an amplifying mechanism for the protonisation of the bicarbonate ion is motivated.},
